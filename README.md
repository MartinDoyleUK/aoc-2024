# Advent of Code 2024

This repo is to store my [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) submissions for 2024.

## Setup

You will need [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) to run this properly. Just use `npm i -g pnpm` to get setup with it. Then simply go to the project folder and run `pnpm i` to install the dependencies.

## Running

To run the whole project, just run `pnpm start`, which will run all of the days' tasks.

## Developing

In development mode, only the most recent day found will run. You will need two terminal windows/tabs/panes to run this.

In the first window, start the compilation tasks by running `pnpm watch` and then in the second run the actual puzzles with `pnpm dev`. This gives a live-reloading terminal view of the answers.

> **TIP:** I run the first "watch" task in _iTerm_ and then run the main "dev" task in a terminal within VSCode, so I can see the live results as I type.
